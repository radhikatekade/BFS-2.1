# Time complexity - O(n)
# Space complexity - O(n/2)

# Approach - bfs - Maintain the count of initial fresh oranges and the number of total fresh oranges that
# were able to converted to rotten once we traverse the grid. Also need to maintain the level in the queue
# since we need to know the total time (every level = 1 min) taken to convert fresh oranges rotten.
